# Azure Function - Bounding Box Crop
This Azure Function Crops a new image from an another image, based on the bounding box measurements.

I used this to only extract a barcode from an image, and to save it as a new picture. I used Custom Vision to detect the barcode within the image and use the boundingbox measurements.
